//! This crate provides a simple prefix tree for IP prefixes. Any lookup performs longest-prefix
//! match. This crate supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (from either [ipnet](https://docs.rs/ipnet/2.10.0)
//! or [ipnetwork](https://crates.io/crates/ipnetwork) or [cidr](https://crates.io/crates/cidr)).
//! It also  supports any tuple `(R, u8)`, where `R` is any unsigned primitive integer (`u8`, `u16`,
//! `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, or `usize`).
//!
//! # Comparison with related projects
//!
//! [`ip_network_table-deps-treebitmap`](https://crates.io/crates/ip_network_table-deps-treebitmap)
//! provides an IP lookup table, similar to [`PrefixMap`].
//!
//! The following compares the two approaches in the case of *dense* or *sparse* maps. Each test
//! case performs 100'000 modifications or lookups. However, the dense cases randomly picks any IPv4
//! address, while the sparse case only pick 20 different IPv4 addresses. See `benches/benchmark.rs`
//! for more details.
//!

//! In addition, `prefix-trie` includes a [`PrefixSet`] analogous to `std::collections::HashSet`,
//! including union, intersection and difference operations that are implemented as simultaneous
//! tree traversals. Further, `prefix-trie` has an interface similar to `std::collections`, and
//! offers a general longest-prefix match that is not limited to individual addresses. Finally,
//! `prefix-trie` allows you to (mutably) borrow a sub-trie using views.
//!
//! # Description of the Tree
//!
//! The tree is structured as follows: Each node consists of a prefix, a container for a potential
//! value (`Option`), and two optional children. Adding a new child, or traversing into the tree is
//! done as follows: we look at the most significant bit that is **not** part of the prefix
//! itself. If it is not set, then we take the left branch, and otherwise, we take the right one.
//!
//! # Traversals
//!
//! Any iteration over all elements in the tree is implemented as a graph traversal that will yield
//! elements in lexicographic order.
//!
//! The library offers set operations of different maps or sets. We implement a union, intersection,
//! difference, and covering_difference. These iterators are implemented using simultaneous tree
//! traversals. They will yield elements in lexicographic order. Whenever appropriate, the yielded
//! items will also include the longest prefix match.
//!
//! # [`TrieView`] and [`TrieViewMut`]
//!
//! You can create a view of a (sub)-trie. Such a view has an any node as its root. Any operations
//! on that view will only traverse that node and all its children. You can iterate over all
//! children, search in that sub-trie, and perform set operations (union, intersection, difference,
//! or the covering difference) on them.
//!
//! A view can point to one of three possible nodes:
//! - A node in the tree that is actually present in the map,
//! - A branching node that does not exist in the map, but is needed for the tree structure (or that
//!   was deleted using the function `remove_keep_tree`)
//! - A virtual node that does not exist as a node in the tree. This is only the case if you call
//!   [`TrieView::find`] or [`AsView::view_at`] with a node that is not present in the tree, but
//!   that contains elements present in the tree. Virtual nodes are treated as if they are actually
//!   present in the tree as branching nodes.
//!
//! # Operations on the tree
//!
//! There are several operations one can do on the tree. Regular inserts are handled using the
//! `Entry` structure. An `Entry` is a pointer to a location in the tree to either insert a value or
//! modify an existing one. Removals however are different.
//!
//! The following are the computational complexities of the functions, where `n` is the number of
//! elements in the tree.
//!
//! | Operation                                  | Complexity |
//! |--------------------------------------------|------------|
//! | `entry`, `insert`                          | `O(log n)` |
//! | `remove`, `remove_keep_tree`               | `O(log n)` |
//! | `remove_children` (calling `drop` on `T`)  | `O(n)`     |
//! | `get`, `get_lpm`, `get_mut`                | `O(log n)` |
//! | `retain`                                   | `O(n)`     |
//! | `clear` (calling `drop` on `T`)            | `O(n)`     |
//! | Operations on [`map::Entry`]               | `O(1)`     |
//! | `len` and `is_empty`                       | `O(1)`     |
//! | `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, ... | `O(n)`     |
//!
//! There are three kinds of removals you! can do:
//!
//! - [`PrefixMap::remove`] will remove an entry from the tree and modify the tree structure as if
//!   the value was never inserted before. [`PrefixMap::remove`] will always exactly revert the
//!   operation of [`PrefixMap::insert`]. When only calling this function to remove elements, you
//!   are guaranteed that the tree structure is indistinguishable to a different tree where you
//!   only inserted elements.
//! - [`PrefixMap::remove_children`] will remove all entries that are contained within the given
//!   prefix. This operation will search for the node with the shortest prefix length that is
//!   contained within the given prefix and remove it, including all of its children.
//! - [`PrefixMap::remove_keep_tree`] will not change anything in the tree structure. It will only
//!   remove a value from a node. As soon as you call `remove_keep_tree` once on a tree structure,
//!   the tree will no longer be optimal.
//!
//! # TODO
//!
//! Migrate to a TreeBitMap, described by
//! [W. Eatherton, Z. Dittia, G. Varghes](https://doi.org/10.1145/997150.997160).
